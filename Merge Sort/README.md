<h3>Merge Sort</h3>

It is a popular sorting algorithm and it is a technique that is widely used. Merge sort uses an approach of divide and conquer algorithm.

The steps that are being followed for Merge Sort are as follows:
<ol>
  <li>Firstly we will divide the array into two equal halves.</li>
  <li>Then these subarrays are further divided into two halves. Now they become array of unit length that can no longer be divided and array of unit length are always sorted.</li>
  <li>Then these two subarrays are merged together and we get bigger sorted subarrays.</li>
  <li>This merging process is continued until the sorted array is built from the smaller subarrays.</li>
</ol>
