<h2>Introduction to OOPS</h2>

Object Oriented Programming System/Structure is a paradigm that is considered an approach to solve problems using programming language or we can say that it is a method to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach.

<h3>Six main pillars of OOPS</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Classes</li>
  <li>Methods and Objects</li>
  <li>Inheritance</li>
  <li>Polymorphism</li>
  <li>Abstraction</li>
  <li>Encapsulation</li>
</ol>

<h3>Class</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It is a collection of objects.</li>
  <li>It is not considered a real world entity. It is just a template or a blueprint.</li>
  <li>Classes do not occupy memory.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Methods</h3>

It contains a set of code that is used to perform a particular task.

Some advantages of Methods are as follows: 
<ul>
  <li>Code Reuseability</li>
  <li>Code Optimization</li>
</ul>

<h3>Object</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It is an instance of class.</li>
  <li>It is a real-world entity.</li>
  <li>It occupies real world entity.</li>
</ul>

Object mainly consists of:
<ul>
  <li>Identity</li>
  <li>Attribute</li>
  <li>Behavior</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Create an Object ?</h3>

We can use the new keyword for creating an object.

There are 3 steps that are being followed:
<ul>
  <li>Declaration</li>
  <li>Instantiation</li>
  <li>Initialization</li>
</ul>

<h3>Declaration</h3>
It is used for declaring a variable name with an object type.

<h3>Instantiation</h3>
This is when the memory is allocated for an object. The new keyword is used to create an object. A reference to the object that was created is returned from the new keyword.

<h3>Initialization</h3>
The new keyword is followed by a call to a constructor. This call initializes the new object.
