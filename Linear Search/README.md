<h3>Linear Search</h3>

It is a simple searching algorithm, in this type of search, a sequential search is made over all the items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.

But the main thing to keep in mind is that the linear search is not the best choice when the list of elements is large.
