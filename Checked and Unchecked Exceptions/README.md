<h3>Checked Vs Unchecked Exception</h3>

Checked Exceptions are the exceptions that are checked at compile time. If some code that is written within a method throws a checked exception, then the method must either handle the exception or it must specify the exception using the throws keyword.

Unchecked Exceptions are the exceptions that are not required to be caught or declared in a throws clause. These exceptions are usually caused by programming errors.
