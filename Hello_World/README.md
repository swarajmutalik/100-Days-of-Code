Following are the set of terminologies that are present in all the java programs:

Class - It is a keyword that is used to define that a new class is being defined.

Main - It is an identifier that is the name of the class.

public - It is an access modifier,indicating that the main method can be accessed from outside the class.

static - It means that the method or the variable belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class.Without the use of the static keyword, you would need to create an instance of the class containing the main method before invoking it, which is not possible when the program starts. Making main static allows it to be called directly by the JVM.

void - It is used because the main method doesn't return anything.

main() - It is defined as the entry point of the java app and it is manadatory in a java program.

String[] - It signifies that the main method accepts a single arguement i.e., an array of elements of type String.

System - It is the predefined class that is used to provide the access to the system.

out - It is te variable of type output stream that is connected to the console.
