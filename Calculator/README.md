<h3>Switch Statement</h3>

The switch expression is evaluated once, the value of the expression is compared with the values of each case and if there is a match then that block of code is executed.

The break and the default keywords are the two keywords that are being used with the switch statement.

The break keyword is used for the purpose of stopping the execution of the code and case testing inside the block.

The default keyword is used for the purpose that if there is no match found then the value that is present in the default is printed out.
