<h3>try catch</h3>

Whenever there is exception, the method in which exception occurs will create an object and that object will store 3 things
<ul>
  <li>Exception name</li>
  <li>Description</li>

</ul>

Some keywords through which we can handle exception are as follows
<ul>
  <li>try</li>

  <li>throw</li>
  <li>throws</li>
