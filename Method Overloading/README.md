<h3>Polymorphism</h3>

Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming. Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways.The word "poly" means many and the word "morphism" means forms. 

There are 2 different types of polymorphism

<ol>
  <li>Compile-Time Polymorphism- It is also known as static polymorphism and it is achieved using method overloading.</li>

  <h3>Method Overloading</h3>

  when there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be overloaded.

Some conditions that should be kept in mind when applying the concept of method overloading are
  <ol>
    <li>Same method name</li>
    <li>Different parameters</li>
    <li>In the same class</li>
  </ol>
  <br>
  <li>Runtime Polymorphism - It is also known as Dynamic Polymorphism and it is achieved using method overriding.</li>

  <h3>Method Overriding</h3>

  It happens when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class, then that base function is said to be overridden.

Some conditions that should be kept in mind when applying the concept of method overriding are
  <ol>
    <li>Same method name</li>
    <li>Same parameters</li>
    <li>In different class</li>
    <li>There must be inheritance between superclass and subclass</li>
  </ol>
