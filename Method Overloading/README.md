<h3>Polymorphism</h3>

Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming. Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways.The word "poly" means many and the word "morphism" means forms. 

There are 2 different types of polymorphism

<ol>

  <h3>Method Overloading</h3>

  when there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be overloaded.
  
  <li>Runtime Polymorphism - </li>
</ol>
