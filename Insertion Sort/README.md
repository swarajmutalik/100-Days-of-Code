<h3>Insertion Sort</h3>

It is an algorithm that is used for the purpose of doing simple sorting. It is similar to how we sort our playing cards. In this the array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part and the values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct place in the sorted array.
