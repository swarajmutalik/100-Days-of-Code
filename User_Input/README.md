Scanner class is used to get the user input and it is found in the java.util package.

To use the Scanner class, we have to create an object of the class and we can then use any of the available methods that are present in the Scanner class.

Some of the input types that present are as follows:

<ul>
  <li>nextBoolean() -	Reads a boolean value from the user</li>
  <li>nextByte() - Reads a byte value from the user</li>
  <li>nextDouble() - Reads a double value from the user</li>
  <li>nextFloat()	- Reads a float value from the user</li>
  <li>nextInt() -	Reads a int value from the user</li>
  <li>nextLine() - Reads a String value from the user</li>
  <li>nextLong() - Reads a long value from the user</li>
  <li>nextShort() - Reads a short value from the user</li>
</ul>
