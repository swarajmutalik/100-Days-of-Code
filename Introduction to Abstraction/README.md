<h3>Abstraction</h3>

It is hiding the internal implementations and just highlighting the setup services that are of importance.

Some key points that are to be kept in mind when applying the concept of Abstraction are
<ol>
  <li>A method without a body is known as an abstract method.</li>
  <li>An abstract method must always be declared in an abstract class.</li>
  <li>If a normal class extends an abstract class, then the class must implement all the abstract methods of the abstract parent class.</li>
  <li>These methods are meant to be overridden in derived concrete classes otherwise there will be an issue of compile time and an error will get generated.</li>
  <li>We can't create an object of abstract class.</li>
</ol>
